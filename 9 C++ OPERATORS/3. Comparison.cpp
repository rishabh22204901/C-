// Comparison Operators
// Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

// The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

// In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

//     ==	                              Equal to	                         x == y	

//     !=	                              Not equal	                         x != y	

//     >	                              Greater than	                     x > y	

//     <	                              Less than	                         x < y	

//     >=	                              Greater than or equal to	         x >= y	

//     <=	                              Less than or equal to	             x <= y
