// C++ Math
// C++ has many functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.


// Max and min

// The max(x,y) function can be used to find the highest value of x and y:
// The min(x,y) function can be used to find the lowest value of x and y:


// C++ <cmath> - Header
// Other functions, such as sqrt (square root), round (rounds a number) and log (natural logarithm), can be found in the <cmath> header file:

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main(){

    cout << sqrt(64) << "\n";
    cout << round(2.7) << "\n";
    cout << log(2) << "\n";
    cout << max(2, 4) << "\n";
    cout << min(2, 4) << "\n";
}
